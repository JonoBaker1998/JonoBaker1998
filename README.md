- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan Baker.
I am a Masters Student in Quantitative Finance.
I am interested in developing solutions to problems faced in the financial markets using machine learning techniques.

I have only started my Github repository this past year and I will be updating it with various projects as I complete them. Future interests include Forecasting Implied Volatility movements and further research into Deep Hedging of options. I also plan on learning some Natural Language Processing, and experimenting with some applications to the financial marketes.
